# FinCoach AI
## **🔹 Problem Statement**
Financial literacy is essential, but finding **trustworthy**, **comprehensive**, and **beginner-friendly** content can be challenging. Many people struggle to navigate financial topics like investing, budgeting, or taxes, often relying on fragmented and overwhelming sources of information.

## **🔹 Solution**
🚀 **FinCoach AI** is an **AI-powered financial coaching tool** that provides **personalized, structured financial guidance** by leveraging **YouTube educational videos** and **Gemini AI**. Instead of searching and sifting through multiple videos manually, users can **ask a question**, and our app finds, summarizes, and presents **curated financial advice** in an easy-to-understand format.

## **🔹 How It Works**
1️⃣ **User asks a financial question** (e.g., "How do I start investing?")  
2️⃣ **YouTube Data API** fetches **relevant financial videos**, filtered by **views, engagement, and relevance**.  
3️⃣ **Transcripts of the videos** are extracted.  
4️⃣ **Gemini AI** processes the transcript and generates a **concise financial coaching response** tailored to the user’s query.  
5️⃣ **The frontend displays**:
   - An **AI-generated financial guide** based on the videos.
   - A **list of relevant YouTube videos** with links and short summaries.  
6️⃣ **Users can take notes** on the AI-generated advice and refer to the videos for further learning.

## **🔹 Technologies Used**
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React, TailwindCSS)  
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)  
- **APIs:** YouTube Data API, Gemini AI  
- **Database:** Firebase (for user notes)  

## **🔹 Why It Stands Out**
✅ **AI-powered personalized financial coaching**  
✅ **Saves time by summarizing long videos**  
✅ **Reliable content sourced from trusted YouTube educators**  
✅ **Interactive note-taking for better learning retention**  

## **🔹 Potential Use Cases**
- Beginners wanting **quick, structured financial advice**  
- Students learning **investment, budgeting, or credit management**  
- Professionals seeking **targeted insights on financial topics**  

🔹 **FinCoach AI democratizes financial education, making it more accessible and efficient for everyone.** 🚀
